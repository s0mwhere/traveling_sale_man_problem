The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem in which a single traveler must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, while minimizing the total travel cost (distance, time, or weight). The order of visiting cities is not fixed, and the cost between cities is known.

the solving process: 
A graph with numerate node contain a number of required node
-> A* -> A graph contain only required node and the shortes path between them
-> christofied alogrithm -> A base answer (graph with the optimal path)
-> 3 opt -> improving the answer
